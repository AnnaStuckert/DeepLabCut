# PyTorch DeepLabCut API

This is written primarily for maintainers and expert users. It details the logic for the DLC3.0 pytorch code. It is a WIP and will be expanded before the full release in 2024. -#teamDLC Dec 2023

**Structure of the pytorch DLC code:**

This repo contains: models (architectures), solvers (losses and optimizers), and data (data loaders).

[Solvers](#solvers)   
[Data](#data)  
[API](#API)   

## Models

- [models](models):
The `deeplabcut.pose_estimations_pytorch.models` package contains all components related to building a model with `backbone`, `neck` (optional) and `head`.

We provide state-of-the-art models such as DLCRNet, HRNet, BUCTD, TransPose, ... more are coming!

If you want to add a novel model, you need to divide it into a model backbone, neck and head. Often the 'neck' will be just the identity function.

For instance, a [standard pose estimation HRNet](https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Human-Pose-Estimation) consists of HRNet backbone, an identity neck and a deconvolution head (Simple Head).


## Solvers

- [solvers](solvers): The `deeplabcut.pose_estimations_pytorch.train_module` contains all classes for model training and validation.

## Data

- [data](data/project.py#L7):
The `deeplabcut.pose_estimations_pytorch.data` package contains all code for pytorch dataset creation and test/train splitting.
    - `Project` class provides train and test splitting and converts dataset to required format. For instance, to [COCO](https://medium.com/@manuktiwary/coco-format-what-and-how-5c7d22cf5301) format.

    Example:

    ```python3
    import deeplabcut.pose_estimation_pytorch as dlc

    project = dlc.Project(proj_root=config['project_root'])
    project.train_test_split()
    ```
    - `PoseDataset` class is an instance of [torch.utils.Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html), which converts raw images and keypoints to a tensor dataset for training and evaluation.

    Example:

    ```python3
    transform = None
    train_dataset = dlc.PoseDataset(project,
                                    transform=transform,
                                    mode='train')
    valid_dataset = dlc.PoseDataset(project,
                                    transform=transform,
                                    mode='test')
    ```

    > **Note**
    > `transform` is a `List` of transformations to be applied to images and keypoints sequentially, `None` by default.

    Example:

    ```python3
    import albumentations as A

    transform = A.Compose([
    A.Resize(width=256, height=256),
    ], keypoint_params=A.KeypointParams(format='xy'))

    ```

    > **Warning**
    > By now supports only [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai), will be extended in the future.


## API

- [API](API): The `deeplabcut.pose_estimations_pytorch.apis` contains functionalities for training and testing as well as the corresponding configuration file [config.yaml](apis/config.yaml).

## Registry

- WIP
